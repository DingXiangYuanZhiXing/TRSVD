# Introduction

Tensors are higher-order extensions of matrices. In recent work <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>, the authors introduced the notion of the t-product, a generalization of matrix multiplication for tensors of order three. The multiplication is based on a convolution-like operation, which 	can be implemented efficiently using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Based on t-product, there has a similar linear algebraic structure of tensors to matrices. For example, there has the tensor SVD (t-SVD) which is computable. By using some properties of FFT, we have a more efficient way for computing t-product and t-SVD in  <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[2]</a>. We develop a Matlab toolbox to implement several basic operations on tensors based on t-product.

The table below gives the list of functions implemented in our toolbox. The detailed definitions of these tensor concepts, operations and tensor factorizations are given at <a href="../tproduct/manual.pdf" class="textlink" target="_blank">https://github.com/canyilu/tproduct/manual.pdf</a>. Note that we only focus on 3 way tensor in this toolbox. We will develop the same functions for p-way tensor in the near future. We will also provide the python verion soon.
